<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>According to a contemporary, a
regiment quartered at Pembroke Dockyard
had lost two thousand blankets
"by pilfering." We shudder to think
what a real Pembroke burglar would
get away with.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"I am a looker for things," said a
man at Willesden tribunal last week
when asked what his occupation was.
The nation, which is paying £5,000,000
a day for the privilege of pursuing the
same occupation, would be interested
to compare notes with him on the
question of whether anything ever
turns up.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"A Saxon pot, quite perfect, has
been found at St. Martha's
Hill, near Guildford," says
a morning paper. Here is
striking evidence in support
of the charge, which
has more than once been
levelled, that influential
alien enemies are still at
large with the connivance
of the authorities.</p>

<p>"The life-blood of England
to-day is sulphuric
acid," said a Professor at
University College the
other day. That is certainly
the impression one
gets from reading the
more vitriolic section of
our Press.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The London County
Council is teaching Esperanto.
The innovation is
intended to meet the needs of the
lady tram-conductors, to whom convention
denies the right to "suffer
and be strong" in words of general
currency.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A soldier who lost his speech at the
battle of Loos has recovered it as the
result of an operation for appendicitis.
He has the added satisfaction of knowing
that greater soldiers than he have
been compelled by the exigencies of the
present War to swallow their words.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At Willesden a conscientious objector
has eaten a £1 note in preference to
giving it up in part payment of his fine
of forty shillings. It would probably
work out cheaper in the end to swallow
the Compulsion Bill.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>While the Ealing Inspector of Shops
is serving in the Army his official duties
are to be carried on by his wife. It is
no doubt in anticipation of other positions
of this sort being thrown open to
the female sex that so many women
can nowadays be seen familiarising
themselves with this class of war work
in Regent Street and its neighbourhood.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In a recent appeal case a man who had
received sentences amounting to twenty-six
years begged to be put under chloroform,
as he had heard that people under
the influence of this drug always told
the truth when they were asked questions.
As a fact, however, the most that
the medical profession have ever claimed
for it in this way is that it often enables
them to get a little inside information.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Belfast man who was fined for
groaning at Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> is understood
to have informed a sympathetic friend
that if he'd known that ten shillings
was all he would be fined, begorra, he'd
have had thirty-shillings' worth, so he
would.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"To get and keep an upright carriage,"
says a woman-writer in <i>The
Daily Mail</i>, "stand with the feet
eighteen inches apart and the hands
clasped above the head. Now, as if
chopping wood, swing the hands down
between the parted feet, then bring
them up over the head again, and
repeat the movement twenty times or
so." Personally, as we consider it bad
form to keep any sort of carriage just
now, we shall remain faithful to the
less spectacular custom of whistling
for a taxi.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>From the Personal column of <i>The
Times</i>:&mdash;"Airman will bring down
Zeppelins. Ladies, Gentlemen." An
excellent idea in the present condition
of our own Air Service. As in the
well-known case of the male and female
gondolas, one of each gender to breed
from would do for a beginning.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As a war economy the London
County Council have disposed of the
major part of the waterfowl that used
to adorn the London Parks. A few
ornamental geese however are still to
be seen in the neighbourhood of the
War Office.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We feel bound to take exception to
the levity of a contemporary, which
recently introduced an account of a
suicide with the heading: "A Riverside
Scream."</p>

<p>A well-known opera-singer is now
hauling cabbages on a farm. The
ruling passion strong in
War. Bouquets all the

<h2>IN THE AIR IN 1940.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>["Wars of the future will be waged in the air...cities will be
laid waste in a night."&mdash;<i>Press.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>April 20, 1940.</i>&mdash;Liberia, in a moment of Ministerial
exuberance, sends a Note to China alleging the death of
a Krooboy subject who had been forced to study the Chinese
language. An indemnity of £100,000,000 is asked.</p>

<p><i>April 22.</i>&mdash;China, mildly surprised, promises investigation.
Owing to an oversight, however, the reply is sent
in Chinese characters, which gives the Liberians a just
<i>casus belli</i>.</p>

<p><i>April 23.</i>&mdash;Liberia despatches her one airship to China
<i>viâ</i> Tibet. Many bombs are dropped on the Chinese Empire
and several rice-fields are quite spoilt. The Chinese Ambassador,
whom the airship conveyed from Liberia, is also
dropped&mdash;and spoilt.</p>

<p><i>April 24.</i>&mdash;China sends four airships to bomb Liberia.
These, however, are unable to locate the Black Republic
and return, after dispensing with the company of the
Liberian Ambassador while over Lake Chad.</p>

<p><i>April 26.</i>&mdash;China addresses a curt Note to Liberia, requesting
her to be good enough to state her exact whereabouts.</p>

<p><i>May 1.</i>&mdash;The Grand Lama directs a plaintive Note to
Liberia, alleging that on April 23 a Liberian airship violated
the neutrality of Tibet.</p>

<p><i>May 3.</i>&mdash;Liberia, never having heard of Tibet, but
believing the G.L. to be a species of camel and a great
fetish, publishes an apology in <i>The Liberian Times (and
Advertiser)</i>, which, however, does not circulate in Tibet.</p>

<p><i>May 4.</i>&mdash;China, after exhaustive inquiries, despatches
another air-fleet, but again fails to locate her quarry.</p>

<p><i>May 5.</i>&mdash;Liberia again raids China by air. Some stones
in the Great Wall are badly chipped.</p>

<p><i>May 7.</i>&mdash;Liberia issues her first official communiqué
through the medium of <i>The Liberian Times (and Advertiser)</i>:&mdash;"On
the night of May 5-6 our Naval and Military
airship attacked the Chinese cities of Pekin, Hankow and
others too intricate of pronunciation to be mentioned here.
Incendiary and explosive bombs were dropped on the fortifications,
gun emplacements, waterworks and waxworks at
Pekin. A battery and many hens were silenced at Hankow.
Our entire air-fleet returned safely and hurriedly."</p>

<p><i>May 9.</i>&mdash;The G.L. of Tibet sends another Note to
Liberia, protesting against a further grave infringement
of neutrality, several eggs of dubious quality and the
remnants of an unsavoury stew having been dropped from
a Liberian airship on Tibetan territory on the night of
May 5-6.</p>

<p><i>May 11.</i>&mdash;Liberia publishes another apology, and sacks
her air <i>chef</i>.</p>

<p><i>May 13.</i>&mdash;Two squadrons of Chinese airships scour the
globe but cannot find Liberia. Several are forced to land
in the Arctic Circle and are interned by the Esquimaux.</p>

<p><i>May 15.</i>&mdash;The G.L. of Tibet sends another Note to
Liberia.</p>

<p><i>May 16.</i>&mdash;Liberia, owing to a paper shortage, makes no
reply.</p>

<p><i>May 17.</i>&mdash;Liberia adopts the Group System.</p>

<p><i>May 18.</i>&mdash;Introduction of "starring and badging" in
Liberia. Owing to a slight miscalculation all trades and
professions are "reserved."</p>

<p><i>May 19.</i>&mdash;Liberia abandons Group System.</p>

<p><i>May 24.</i>&mdash;Liberia again despatches her airship to China
<i>viâ</i> Tibet. The raider falls in flames near the Forbidden
City, the commander having been rather careless with his
cigar in one of the gas chambers.</p>

<p><i>May 25.</i>&mdash;The G.L. of Tibet buys a typewriter and
some carbon sheets, and begins a campaign of daily Notes
to Liberia.</p>

<p><i>May 26</i>-June 5.&mdash;Liberia lies low.</p>

<p><i>June 7.</i>&mdash;China, after fifteen futile attempts to locate
Liberia, sues for peace, asking Liberia to send an envoy
who will be able to guide airships carrying Peace delegates
and the first instalment of indemnity to Liberia.</p>

<p><i>July 12.</i>&mdash;Ten Chinese airships, loaded with Peace delegates
and money, and piloted by the Liberian envoy, travel
to the Black Republic. Arrived over the much-sought
country, the Peace delegates drop their pilot and aid the
airships' crews in wiping Liberia off the face of the earth.</p>

<p><i>July 14.</i>&mdash;The G.L. of Tibet disposes of his typewriter at
a considerable loss.</p>

<h2>In a Good Cause.</h2>

<p>Mr. <i>Punch</i> is bound to plead for <span class="smcap">The Children's Aid
Committee</span>, who undertake the care of the motherless
children of our fighting men, feeding and clothing them
and finding homes for them in the country. This labour
of love has far outgrown the modest scope of its original
plan and now stands in urgent need of assistance. Except
for a Christmas Gifts Fund no appeal has yet been made
to the public in the Press. Mr. <i>Punch</i> is very confident
that he will not ask in vain for help in a cause that so
nearly touches the hearts of all; and that he may rely
on his many generous readers to see that this good work
does not fail, both for the children's sake and for the
comfort of their fathers who are fighting our battles.</p>

<p>Gifts of money and clothing, and offers of hospitality
will be very gratefully acknowledged by Miss <span class="smcap">Maxwell-Lyte</span>,
Hon. Treasurer of The Children's Aid Committee,
9, South Molton Street, London, W.

<h2>BLANCHE'S LETTERS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Land-Ladies.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="i4"><i>A Farm,</i></span><br />
<i>Somewhere in the Country.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Daphne,</span>&mdash;I'm on the land!
<i>Several</i> of us are on the land! No one
need worry any more about agriculture
and rotation of crops and all that
sort of thing being stopped by the
War. We're going to see to it. It
is positively <i>enthralling</i> work! Lady
Man&oelig;uvrer wrote me an agonised letter
the other day, asking me if I thought
there'd be any season in London, and
if it would be worth her while
to take a house and give some
parties for Bluebell. And I
wrote back: "Please&mdash;<i>please</i>
don't talk to me about London
and seasons and <i>parties</i>! I
know absolutely <i>nothing</i> of
such matters. I'm on the
land!" And I wound up with,
"This comes hopping," in real
farmers' style.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50">

  <p><i>Recruit (much perturbed).</i> "<span class="smcap">If you please, Sergeant, the
  other fellows say I've got to grow a moustache.</span>"</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant.</i> "<span class="smcap">Oh, there's no compulsion about growing a
  moustache, my lad; but you mustn't shave your upper
  lip.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>I wish you could see me
ploughing, dearest. My ploughman's
pinny, big soft hat and
leggings are a dream. (<i>À propos</i>,
the "ploughman's pinny"
is going to be <i>the</i> summer coat
this year.) Oh, my Daphne,
I plough such an adorable furrow!
Yesterday, when I was
at it, the oldest inhabitant
came and leaned on a gate
to watch me&mdash;one of those
fearful creatures, you know,
who've lived through six reigns
and can read small print and
smoke six pipes a day, and
end by getting into the daily
papers.</p>

<p>"Be you one o' they fine
Lunnon ladies wot 'ave come
to these parts to blay at varmin'?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"We haven't come to <i>play</i> at farming,"
I told him; "we've come to
take the men's places and help save
the country."</p>

<p>"Yon's a wunnerful bad furrow,"
said the creature. "And what be goin'
to sow in it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, corn or chaff, or whatever it is
people eat, I suppose," I said.</p>

<p>"Seems to Oi the right crop for such
a wunnerful crooked furrow as yon
'ud be <i>tares</i>," said the horrid old
thing; "but happen you don't know
what tares be&mdash;happen you don't read
your Bible."</p>

<p>I was starting up the field again by
that time and paid no more attention
to him. The oldest inhabitant is <i>proverbially</i>
a most unpleasant character,
I believe. Beryl and Babs are also
doing very well down here. And now
that we've learned all about farming
and agriculture we're training <i>numbers</i>
of girls and putting them on the
land, (<i>Entre nous, chérie</i>, it's not so
difficult to <i>put</i> them on the land as to
<i>keep</i> them on it. Some of them are a
wee bit inclined to "put their hands to
the plough and look black," to quote
dear <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, that we've all been
talking of so much lately.) Beryl has
developed positively <i>shining</i> gifts as a
<i>drover</i>.  She drives cattle into the
nearest market town twice a week,
and does it <i>à merveille</i>. (I <i>can't</i> say
the dear thing's drover's coat and
hat are becoming&mdash;indeed, I never
saw her look worse!) She has a large
class of women and girls learning to
be drovers. But unluckily, the other
day, there was a regrettable little
affair. Beryl was taking a big herd
of cattle along to the market town,
with her class in attendance, when
one of the bullocks stopped to nibble
at the hedge. Beryl told a girl in the
class to give it a tap and send it on.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid to," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Beryl, "you city girls
are duffers at country life! What's
there to be afraid of?" and she went
up to the bullock and gave it a smart
whack with her drover's stick. "Come,"
said, "no nonsense! Go on with
the others," and she gave it a harder
whack.</p>

<p>In a moment the creature turned
upon her with a simply <i>odious</i> expression
in its eyes and began to bellow;
and <i>then</i>, dearest&mdash;<i>wasn't</i> it a pity?&mdash;Beryl
suddenly lost her nerve, dropped
her drover's stick, and climbed to the
top of a big gate near at hand, while
the class ran back along the road,
shrieking. As for the cattle, terrified
by the shrieks of the class, they took
to their heels (if they have such things),
and were finally stopped by a farmer,
who drove them into the market himself.</p>

<p>Everyone's so glad General Dodderidge
is better. You remember his
marrying Mittie Jermyn <i>en
troisièmes noces</i> some years
ago? The wedding was at
Newmarket; Mittie was
married in her racing colours,
and her famous Oaks and One
Thousand winner, "Give-'em-beans,"
was her only bridesmaid.
It was quite a nice
marriage, but they've not seen
much of each other for several
years. Poor Mittie was fearfully
<i>affaissée</i> when the War
hit racing so hard; but she's
found herself again now, and
the last we heard of her she
was buying and breaking
horses for the Remount Department
somewhere in the
world. The dear General, being
enormously old, couldn't
take any part in the War, but
he was like the war-horse,
you know, dearest, mentioned
by the Psalmist, that "sayeth
Ha, ha! through a trumpet";
he read <i>every</i> daily and weekly
paper, with all the conflicting
reports from both sides, till at
last he was in a frightful state.
Sir William Kiddem took him
in hand, he said, only just
in time to save his cerebral
spheres and nerve centres from doing
something horrible in a dozen syllables.
And now, with newspapers taboo and
a milk and egg diet, the old darling is
so much better that he helped at our
matinée in town the other day in aid
of the "Fund for Manicuring Amateur
Farm Hands."</p>

<p>All the people one knows were perfectly
sweet in placing their talents at
one's disposal for the benefit of the
Fund. (Has it ever struck you, my
Daphne, how <i>much</i> readier people are
to offer their <i>talents</i> than their <i>money</i>?&mdash;even
though they may have <i>immensely</i>
more of the latter than the
former.) It was a tremendous programme.
General Dodderidge, who said
he'd been considered a very good ventriloquist
in his time, gave a turn with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
one of those doll-things. I'm sure it
was a topping turn, because the dear
General laughed so often himself at the
things he was saying. Several people,
however, said that the voice, when they
could hear it, seemed to be always the
General's and never the doll's; but
there'll always be grumblers.</p>

<p>The gem of the afternoon was certainly
Hermione Shropshire's song and
dance, "Sal of the Supper Club." She
was coached by the famous Jenny Jolliwell,
who's called "The Diva of the
Dials;" and I hear that Jenny (who was
one of our programme-sellers) said afterwards,
"Lumme, duchess, you went
one better than me, you did, straight!
If I dared to give 'Sal' like that at
the Syndicate Halls I'd have the Lord
High What's-his-name down on me
in two ticks!"</p>

<h2>ENGLAND CAUGHT OUT.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">As Detected Through German
Spectacles.</span></p>

<p>The malignant and perfidious English
have again to eat their own words.
Indeed, they have eaten them. It will
be remembered that on every occasion
of one of our glorious Zeppelin raids
our official report of the damage done,
notwithstanding the meticulous accuracy
which those who draw up the
reports impose upon themselves, has
been angrily contradicted by the English
Press, always under some heading
attributing habitual mendacity and
wilful and continuous dishonesty to
the German headquarters.</p>

<p>Germans do not lie. There is no
need. Their deeds are so terrific and
sweeping as it is that the slightest embroidery
or exaggeration would produce
an effect to stagger humanity. Hence
when our reports said on one occasion
that our Zeppelins had irretrievably
damaged the fortified town of Margate,
and on another occasion that our Zeppelins
had practically destroyed the
formidable garrison of Ramsgate, and
on a third occasion that our Zeppelins
had almost eliminated that English
Kronstadt, Yarmouth, and on a fourth
occasion that the menacing citadel of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Cromer had been reduced to ruins, and
on a fifth occasion that the hitherto
impregnable fortress of Lowestoft had
become pregnable owing to the wonderful
science of the revered Count <span class="smcap">Zeppelin</span>&mdash;when
our reports said these things
they recorded facts, although the reptile
English Press instantly hissed out
denials and attacks.</p>

<p>But justice will prevail, even in
England, although one may have to
wait long for it. And now, some while
after these magnificently successful
raids, the admission is made that our
official reports, so suspect and derided,
were right all the time. In one of the
leading English papers we find the following
words in an article entitled,
"Prospects for the Summer Holidays."
For it seems that, in spite of the famine
and other hardships which the immortal
German army and supreme
German navy are inflicting upon England,
some of these trivial islanders are
proposing to go to the seaside as usual
this year&mdash;either out of a paltry bravado
or by arrangement with the Government
to create an illusion of prosperity and
composure. But, whereas normally
the watering-places of the whole country
are open to them for their obscene
and brutish frolics, this year they are
not expected to patronise the East
coast&mdash;that is to say the English shores
of the German Ocean. And why?
The reason is not without its flattery
to us; and it also carries with it the
damning admission of the absolute exactitude,
the minute veracity of the
German official reports of the Zeppelin
raids which previously the English
papers had conspired to impugn. We
give the precise words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is, we fear, every reason
to anticipate a barren season for the
East Coast resorts, usually so popular.
From Margate and Ramsgate, right
up through Lowestoft, Yarmouth,
Cromer and Cleethorpes to Scarborough
and Whitby, they have, it cannot
be denied, been <i>badly hit</i> by the
Zeppelin raids."</p></blockquote>

<p>The italics are ours. Note them
well, for they are the measure of English
turpitude. When, after our shattering
and comprehensive raids had
occurred, one by one, always with such
devastating fury and precision, our reports
announced that these very towns
had been "badly hit" (mark the phrase!),
the English Press once more accused
us of perversion and dissimulation.
How right we were is now proved. In
fact it seems that we understated the
case, for we gather that a very large
number of East Coast towns have been
badly hit by our irresistible machines of
retribution&mdash;far more than we knew.</p>

<p>If we wait long enough we shall
doubtless find somewhere in an English
paper the verification of other of our
claims, which at the time were treated
with contempt&mdash;such, for example, as
the glorious destruction of Liverpool
and Manchester by bombs from the sky.
All that we need is a little patience.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHERCHEZ LES TABLEAUX;</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Or, The Culprit à la Mode.</span></p>

<p>During the trial of George Smith
for obtaining the sum of five hundred
pounds by means of a forged cheque, it
was proved that the prisoner spent a
portion of the money in the purchase of
a ninepenny admission to a local cinema.
The learned judge, speaking with considerable
warmth, observed that he
hoped the Press would make a careful
note of that fact. It entirely confirmed
a belief he himself had long held,
namely, that the existence of such
places afforded a temptation to wrongdoing
that was nothing short of a
public menace. He only wished that
he had power to sentence the proprietor.
(Applause.)</p>

<hr />

<p>During the hearing of a petition for
breach of promise of marriage, evidence
was given that the behaviour of defendant
had changed since he witnessed
the performance of a certain film entitled,
"Mr. Quiverful keeps House."</p>

<p>Mr. Dodge, K.C. (for the plaintiff)
put in a scenario of the film, showing
that it represented the troubles of a
paterfamilias forced to look after a
crowd of children, pacify indignant
servants, and the like. It was unquestionable
that such an exhibition might
produce a very serious effect upon a
timid and impressionable bachelor.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> It is perfectly monstrous
that such things should be
tolerated.</p>

<p>Counsel, continuing, said he believed
that there was also introduced a mother-in-law.
At this point the jury stopped
the case, and awarded the plaintiff
three thousand pounds damages.</p>

<hr />

<p>Arrested on a charge of severely
wounding a neighbour with a shotgun,
a prisoner at Birmingham pleaded
that he had been led astray by a visit
paid to a picture-house, where films of
cowboy life were being exhibited. It
was true that his parents were both
doing time, and he had two uncles
in an asylum, but he attributed his
own downfall entirely to the pernicious
influence of the cinema.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> I am glad you appreciate
that fact.</p>

<p>Counsel for the defence here stated
that the victim was now ascertained to
have been a writer of picture-plays.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Why didn't you say so
before? That entirely alters the complexion
of the case. I am not sure
that the prisoner has not rendered a
public service.</p>

<p>By direction of his Lordship the
charge was subsequently amended to
one of using firearms without a licence,
and, a nominal fine having been imposed,
the accused left the dock amid
general congratulations.</p>

<h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

<p class="center">XL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Charles,</span>&mdash;The weather
has changed and War has resumed a
less uncomfortable aspect. The last I
heard of our friend Persius Adolphus
(now promoted to the giddy heights of
Second-Lieutenant, but still referred
to, in the privacy of the traverse, as
"Perse") he was living <i>al fresco</i> in his
little bit of trench, leading the sinful
life with a pot of <i>páté de foie gras</i>
in the one hand and the latest number
of <i>La Vie Parisienne</i> in the other. It
takes a lot of H.E. to distract a man's
attention from these luxuries, which
goes to show that, if at times it is a
short life, it is in spring a merry one,
and a twenty-franc note will in these
parts provide a man with all the most
extravagant pleasures of the idle rich
for a month.</p>

<p>To the officer in the trench, Battalion
Headquarters, a few hundred yards to
the rear, is a veritable pleasaunce far
removed from the din and worry of
battle. To the C.O. and his satellites,
putting up with their dangers and
discomforts for a noble cause, Brigade
Headquarters, a mile down the road, is
a palace of safety and ease, where any
man but a fool of a Brigadier would
remain. To the Brigade Staff, grimly
holding on in its rough and perilous
fortress, the Divisional villa is the
ideal of quiet residences. To the Divisional
Staff, suffering silently, the
Corps Château is all that a man could
ask in the way of handsome furnished
apartments. And to the Corps Staff it
is ever a matter of surprise that its
miserable hovel can be contemplated
without a blush by the Army Staff,
revelling, as the latter does, in every
modern convenience. The Army Staff
says nothing but thinks bitterly of
those at G.H.Q., and by the time it
gets to the War Office I couldn't tell
you what the grouse is or whose the
envied lot. The real wallower out
here is, if we all did but know it, some
little known and unobtrusive C.O. of
some special company, with a village
to himself, half-a-dozen châteaux to
choose from, more motors than he
knows what to do with, and, wickedest
and worst, a real bath to wash in.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the eyes of all rest
upon the same unwarlike pictures torn
from the same least bellicose journal.
From dug-out to palace, faded walls are
decorated with the same three-colour
process divinities, whose expressions
are as arch as arch and whose clothing
is typical of the wonderful economy of
the French. Through the clamour of
bursting shells or the din of the
military typewriter, turning out its
thousand "Pass Memos." to the hour,
these fair Parisiennes continue to smile
unperturbed, until some officer, callous
rather than modest, hides their bright
blue eyes and bright red cheeks under
a pile of official telegrams relating to
picks and shovels, gas protectors and
other sordid and unromantic matter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the motor lorries creep
demurely along the country lanes,
coming nobody knows whence, going
nobody knows whither. Now and
then they will pause in a convenient
ditch, rubbing their wheels briskly in
the mud to restore the circulation. A
less restful sight is the military car,
proceeding at a pace never exceeding
twenty kilometres per hour, the occupants
of which have also, these days,
adopted the three-colour process, a
sure sign that we are winning. Fortune
favours the brave, and the lightning
despatch-rider as often as not
will pass through the lot, with the loss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
of little more than a couple of limbs
and half-a-dozen spare parts. Even
so, he will not omit to salute you, as
you stand off the road, a sight which
has a peculiar thrill of its own, since
the salute of a motor cyclist consists
in his looking fixedly in one direction
and proceeding recklessly in another.
You cannot help appreciating his
courtesy, but in your more nervous
moments you can't help wishing he
wouldn't do it.</p>

<p>By way of contrast to the business
of it all is the light-blue Gendarme,
unaffected by the entourage of war,
ambling peacefully where he will,
greeting all and sundry with an expansive
smile and growing momentarily
ruddier and more fat in his happy face.
It is his work in life to get in nobody's
way and do no man any harm; it is
his pleasure to wear upon his head a
helmet of the truest steel, of a type
created to ward off hostile shrapnel,
but worn by him for the same good
reason for which a miller wears a
white hat. I count amongst the best
of my newly-found friends a certain
<i>chef</i> of this merry and bright <i>escadron</i>.
An ex-Cavalry Officer, he fought
through the earlier stages of the War,
undaunted by many misadventures.
Since he took to the less hazardous
pastime of commanding <i>gendarmerie</i>,
he has found life not so precarious, may
be, but a good deal more intricate.</p>

<p>He will tell you, if you ask him, the
story of the sacred civilian automobile
which he once ventured to stop in
order to satisfy himself as to its contents.
He did not recognise any significant
halo surrounding it, though
this should have been discernible even
in the cloud of dust accompanying it.
He had his written instructions to see
that the credentials of all who drove
through his zone should be <i>en règle</i>.
Simple and ingenuous as he then was,
written instructions were enough for
him. The car approached him menacingly,
but he stood his horse in the
middle of the road and signed to it to
stop. The car hooted with hoarse and
defiant anger, and a sinister bowler hat
was seen and angry words were heard
at the window. None the less he
stopped it at the risk of his life, and in
his best manner (always a nice one)
demanded credentials.</p>

<p>In wartime, one may interfere with
Jupiter and be forgiven, but my Commandant
had gone too far. He was
lucky to find himself, at the conclusion
of the correspondence, severely admonished
and in receipt of an order to
place himself under arrest for six days
(which he did, choosing six wet ones).</p>

<p>The car contained a Deputy, no less.</p>

<p>The Commandant clings to the childlike
belief that we manage these things
better in England. What would have
happened, he asked me, if he had been
a British officer and the object of his
attention merely a Member of Parliament?
"Merely," indeed! I answered
that the thing simply couldn't be conceived
as happening with us. Our
soldiers, I admitted, were amongst the
bravest of the brave, but I had never
yet met one reckless enough to dream
of obstructing the slightest whim of a
politician.</p>

come back from Dublin, like Lord
<span class="smcap">Beaconsfield</span> from Berlin, bringing
peace with honour in his pack? Or will
he, as so many British statesmen have
done before, find the inherited hostility
of Irishmen to one another an insuperable
obstacle? An hon. and learned Nationalist
was not encouraging. "When,"
he was asked, "were the seeds of this
trouble sown?" "When <span class="smcap">Sthrongbow</span>
came to Ireland," was the answer.
"And when do you think it will
be over?" persisted the questioner.
"When the world's at an end."</p>

<p>Last Session Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span> was easily
the champion of Question-time. But
this year, thanks to the Sinn Feiners,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ginnell</span> is coming up with a rush.
Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span> has however one consolation.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ginnell</span> rarely extracts
much information from Ministers;
often it is nothing more than "There
is no foundation for the allegation contained
in the question." Whereas his
rival, whose queries cover a much
wider field, frequently elicits important
facts. Like the rest of the world he
has been puzzled by the coloured tabs
now so commonly seen on officers'
tunics. What did they mean? Mr.
<span class="smcap">Tennant</span> for once was communicative.
"I think," he said, "green stands for
intelligence." Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span> is now more
regretful than ever that he is over military
age; the green badge would just
suit his mental complexion.</p>

<p>Ever since the Military Service Bill
came under discussion the public galleries
have been full of men in khaki.
As it seems difficult to believe that
their presence is due to the intrinsic
fascination of debates, which have been
for the most part insufferably dull, another
theory has been started. Should
the opponents of the Bill become too
obstructive and threaten its passage,
will these doughty warriors leap over
the barriers, drop down on to the floor
of the House (in the manner already
made historic this Session) and execute
a new "<span class="smcap">Pride's</span> Purge"?</p>

<p>A rather unkind trick was played
upon the Simonites by Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>.
He has a good deal of influence with
the Government nowadays, and when
he delivered an eloquent defence of conscientious
objectors, describing them
as the men who kept the spiritual fires
burning, there were high hopes that
he was going to secure an enlargement
of the loopholes in the Bill. But as
he went on to explain that his remarks
only applied to genuine cases and had
nothing to do with the shoal of frauds
who had discovered a conscience within
the last month or two, the enthusiasm
below the Gangway fell so suddenly
that you could almost hear it drop.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 16th.</i>&mdash;To invite the
House of Lords to go in for daylight
saving is rather like carrying coals to
Newcastle. The Peers habitually set
an excellent example in this respect.
No matter what the importance of the
subject under consideration they almost
invariably manage to conclude its discussion
before the dinner-hour.</p>

<p>Some of Lord <span class="smcap">Lansdowne's</span> friends
are beginning to fear that association
with wicked Radicals like Lord <span class="smcap">Crewe</span>
is having a deteriorating effect upon his
political faith. They were shocked to
hear him allude almost disparagingly to
the innate conservatism of the national
temperament, which put Greenwich
mean time on the same level as the
Thirty-nine Articles. He even spoke
disrespectfully of the sun, to the marked
disapproval of that other shining light,
Lord <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>.</p>

<p>In the Commons the Simonites made
a determined effort to get the minimum
age raised from 18 to 19. But Mr. <span class="smcap">Long</span>
was obdurate, though he promised that,
subject to exceptional military necessity,
no conscript should be sent abroad
till he was 19. Eventually the Bill
passed its Third Reading by 250 to 35.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span></p>

<p>A characteristically bitter speech
from Mr. <span class="smcap">Snowden</span> evoked an appropriate
retort from Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur Markham</span>.
Observing that the Hon. Member had
been against the War throughout, he
charged him with "making vitriolic
speeches and dropping acid drops in
every direction." Mr. <span class="smcap">Snowden</span> (remembering
the case of Mr. <span class="smcap">John Burns</span>)
may think himself lucky if he is not
known as "The Acid Drop" for the
rest of his political career.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, May 17th.</i>&mdash;The Summer
Time Bill passed into law to-day, in
spite of the gloomy prognostications of
Lord <span class="smcap">Balfour of Burleigh</span>. He foresaw
the time when the Committee of
Privileges might be called upon to pronounce
a new judgment of <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> on
the question whether a peerage should
go to a boy born at 2.50 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on
October 1st or to his twin-brother,
born actually half-an-hour later, but
according to statutory time half-an-hour
before.</p>

<p>While the Lords were illuminating
the daylight the Commons were engaged
in ventilating the air. The present
administration of the Flying
Services was severely criticised by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Joynson-Hicks</span>, who wanted an Air
Minister&mdash;not Lord <span class="smcap">Curzon</span>, but "someone
with a reputation to lose." Mr.
<span class="smcap">Tennant</span> promptly announced that the
ex-Viceroy of India would be President
of the new Air Board.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Churchill</span> launched into a
lengthy history of the Air Services,
from which we gathered that but
for the exertions of a former First Lord,
who used to divert money voted for
hospitals and coastguard stations to
the building of aeroplanes, the country
would have had no aerial defences when
the War broke out. He joined in the
demand for an Air Ministry. In fact, he
had himself proposed it to the <span class="smcap">Prime
Minister</span> a year ago. It is possible
that he even indicated a suitable person
to fill the post.</p>

<p>Before the War it was sometimes
said of Lord <span class="smcap">Hugh Cecil</span> that his
Parliamentary speeches were too much
up in the clouds. Since he has taken to
exploring those regions as a member
of the Royal Flying Corps, that criticism
no longer applies. In a severely
practical speech he flatly contradicted
the accusations that had been made
against our Air Service, and boldly
claimed that it was the most efficient
in the world.</p>

<p>After that, Mr. <span class="smcap">Bonar Law</span> had a
comparatively easy task in persuading
the House to give the new Air Board
a fair trial. In reference to the fears
that had been expressed as to the
powers to be accorded to its President
he drily remarked that from his
experience in the Cabinet he did not
think Lord <span class="smcap">Curzon</span> would be found
lacking in personality.</p>

<p>All through the afternoon Mr. <span class="smcap">Pemberton-Billing</span>
had been popping up
with questions, interjections and points
of order. Now he rose to continue the
debate, but Members had apparently
had enough of him for one day. After
a few minutes he suffered the most
inglorious fate that can befall a Parliamentary
crusader. One by one his
audience melted away, until there was
not enough left to make a House.
"P. B." was counted out.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, May 18th.</i>&mdash;Lord <span class="smcap">Lansdowne</span>
at least is not afraid of the
new Order in Council prohibiting
reference to Cabinet proceedings. In
answer to complaints of the delay in
introducing Compulsory Service he
told the old story of the widow who
married a widower, and complained to
a friend that "<i>his</i> children are always
fighting with <i>my</i> children and frightening
<i>our</i> children." That, he implied,
was what went on in the Coalition.</p>

<p>The Commons enjoyed a pretty little
duel between two old friends. Ex-Professor
<span class="smcap">Hewins</span> delivered a long
lecture on elementary economics, leading
up to the conclusion that we could
not beat the Germans without an immediate
dose of Tariff Reform. The
House, expecting an equally solemn
defence of Free Trade from the <span class="smcap">Chancellor
of the Exchequer</span>, was
at once surprised and delighted when
Mr. <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span> rose to reply.</p>

<p>Though tied to the Tariff movement
"by my heart-strings as well as by my
head," he thought it would be imprudent
to embark on it at this moment.
After the War it would very likely meet
with general consent. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hewins</span>
must have felt like <i>Alice</i> with "jam
yesterday, and jam to-morrow, but
never jam to-day."</p>

<h2>DAYLIGHT SAYING.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Nursery View.</span></p>

<p>Last Sunday morning an hour was
lost. The children had been discussing
the question beforehand.</p>

<p>"Where will it go?" asked one.</p>

<p>"I suppose the fairies will take it,"
said Joyce.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will go behind the
clock," said another.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you what I'd like to
do," said Joyce deliberately. "I'd like
to get up in the middle of the night,
when the hour is going to be lost, and
put on my dressing-gown without
waking Nannie, and go out into the
garden and see for myself how they lose
it. It's sure to be about somewhere."</p>

<p>"You couldn't," said one of the
others. "Nannies always sleep so that
they wake up at once if you move.
You'd never get up without her knowing."</p>

<p>"Well, why do they want to lose it?"
asked Joyce, realising that the last
argument was unanswerable and so
darting off on to a new train of
thought altogether.</p>

<p>"Because they'll save a lot of other
hours that way. And then, you see, if we
get up earlier we shan't have to pay the
pennies for gas and electric light, and
all those pennies can go to help Daddy
win the War."</p>

<p>"Yes, but where will the hour be
gone?"</p>

<p>And so we came back to the beginning
again.</p>

<p>There, was a long pause.</p>

<p>"Well," concluded Joyce, on a note
of finality, "it's a very good plan
anyway."</p>

<p>That settled it.</p>

<h2>FROM THE FRONT.</h2>

<p>"Hurrah!" I said, "I've got a letter from the Front."</p>

<p>"Well done!" said Francesca. "Who's it from?"</p>

<p>"From Walter. It's not a very long one."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter a bit. The great thing is to have
one from the Front, even if it's only to thank you for a
pair of socks."</p>

<p>"Mine's better than that," I said. "It runs into nearly
two pages."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "but it doesn't tell you much, now
does it?"</p>

<p>"No, to tell you the truth it doesn't. They're under an
honourable obligation, you know, not to reveal things."</p>

<p>"Poor boys! It isn't much a Second-Lieutenant could
reveal, is it. There's nothing said in your letter about
Sir <span class="smcap">Douglas Haig</span> having called Walter up to Headquarters&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mustn't say Headquarters; you must say G.H.Q.
if you want to impress people."</p>

<p>"I'm not talking to people; I'm talking to you. There's
nothing said in your letter, is there, about Walter having
been asked by Sir <span class="smcap">Douglas Haig</span> to draw up a plan for
the Big Push?"</p>

<p>"No, there isn't; but Walter would draw up a dozen if
he were asked. He's that sort."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about my first cousin once removed in that
flippant way."</p>

<p>"I'm not."</p>

<p>"You are, and it's most ungrateful of you."</p>

<p>"Ungrateful?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ungrateful. He's written you a letter that you'll
be able to chat about for a fortnight. I can hear you
mentioning it to your train-friends, Major Boger and
Dr. Apthorpe. You'll bring it in in a careless kind of
way. 'I've had a letter,' you'll say, 'from a chap at the
Front, a cousin of my wife's, and he tells me they're expecting
a move now at any moment.' Then they'll both
say, 'Ah,' as if they didn't think much of your chap, and
each of them will produce a chap of his own with some
highly private information about the <span class="smcap">Crown Prince</span> having
been taken to a lunatic asylum in a motor-car so heavily
iron-clad that nobody could see who was inside, but he
was recognised by his shrieks; and Dr. Apthorpe will cap
it all with some cock-and-bull story about German ships
having bombarded one another in the Canal last week. And
so you'll get to London."</p>

<p>"Francesca," I said, "you are a holy terror. How do
you know all these things? You have never travelled to
London with Major Boger and Dr. Apthorpe, and yet
you're able to misrepresent them as if you'd heard them
speak every day of your life. It's wonderful."</p>

<p>"Clever fellow," said Francesca; "we won't pursue the
question of your boastings. They're innocent enough, I
dare say. Let me hear what Walter actually does say in
his letter."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "he doesn't actually say very much.
The weather is fine, he says, and his particular lot have
been having rather a slack time lately. There was a
stampede of horses last week, but his Battery was not
involved in it, and would I mind sending him a packet or
two of chocolate, some strong brown boot-laces and a briar-root
pipe, he having broken his last one, and he's never
felt fitter in his life, and anybody who wants to know
what health is had better come out to France at once.
That's about all; but you can read it for yourself." I
handed it over to her and she skimmed through it.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," she said, "I strongly advise you
not to show this letter about."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall show it," I said, "but only to friends."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I wouldn't even do that, unless you
want to get Walter into trouble."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" I said. "It's the most discreet and
honourable letter I ever received.".</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "but it's so cheerful. If certain newspapers
got hold of it there wouldn't be any peace for
Second-Lieutenant Walter Carlyon. He'd be told he was
like all other Englishmen&mdash;he didn't take a serious view of
the War. Then they'd say that he was one of the men
who were responsible for the French not understanding us,
and for the Russians failing to appreciate our efforts, which,
indeed, could hardly be called efforts at all, and for the
Italians despising us as we deserved to be despised for
tolerating such a Government as we were afflicted with&mdash;and
lots more of the same sort, all because poor Walter
doesn't go about in a state of perpetual gloom, as if he
expected the whole of Great Britain to be sunk into the
sea the next minute."</p>

<p>"Francesca," I said, "your warmth is excusable, and
there's a good deal in what you say, but I shall show
Walter's letter all the same."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "when the storm bursts I shall let him
know whom he's got to thank for it."</p>

<p>"I shall write to him," I said, "and warn him to write
a really pessimistic letter next time, so that I may show it
to influential people and get his name up."</p>

<p>"It'll be no good," she said. "Walter isn't one of that
sort. He 's cursed with a profound and unreasoning belief
in his country, and, being an Englishman, he'll go to his
grave if necessary believing that England is bound to win
the War."</p>

<p>"And, by Jove," I said, "I thoroughly agree with him."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "and so do I, but it doesn't do to say so
to everybody nowadays."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>Except by keen politicians the fourth volume of Mr <span class="smcap">Buckle's</span>
<i>Life of Benjamin Disraeli</i> (<span class="smcap">Murray</span>) may be
found a little dull in comparison with its predecessors.
That is not the fault of the biographer, who has done his
best with a vast mass of somewhat dry material, but
could not make this portion of his record so enthralling as
that which preceded it or&mdash;we may confidently hope&mdash;that
which will follow it. In 1855 <span class="smcap">Disraeli</span> had arrived at
respectability, but had not yet attained power. The Conservative
Party recognised that he was indispensable, but
continued to withhold its full confidence, with the result
that, although his brain still teemed with the great schemes
formed in his hot youth, he had to defer their practical
accomplishment and to devote himself to educating his
party and its titular leader, Lord <span class="smcap">Derby</span>, for the day when
the swing of the pendulum might give it a majority in the
House of Commons. Only one great triumph came to him
during these years in the wilderness. <span class="smcap">Disraeli</span> had never
visited India, but, owing perhaps to his Eastern ancestry,
he had a truer intuition of Oriental needs than most
contemporary statesmen; and it was fortunate that it
fell to him in 1858, during one of the brief periods
when the Conservatives held office on sufferance, to carry
the Bill which transferred the government of India
from "John Company" to the Crown. The principles
which he then laid down, and which eighteen years later
he carried a stage further in the Imperial Titles Act, justify
Mr. <span class="smcap">Buckle</span> in claiming the Coronation Durbar of 1911 as
"the logical conclusion of Disraeli's policy." Apart from
this one episode the volume is mainly concerned with the
reconstruction of the Conservative party&mdash;"at about the
pace of a Tertiary formation"&mdash;with which <span class="smcap">Disraeli's</span>
voluminous correspondence with Lord <span class="smcap">Derby</span> was mainly
concerned. Happily he had other correspondents, and,
though too self-conscious to be a perfect letter-writer, he
could be playful enough when writing to his wife or to
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brydges-Williams</span>. In this volume Mr. <span class="smcap">Buckle</span>
has given us a careful portrait of the Politician <span class="smcap">Disraeli</span>;
in his next we look to see a little more of the Man.</p>

<p>It is probable, I think, that you will not have turned
many pages of <i>Brenda Walks On</i> (<span class="smcap">Hutchinson</span>) before
being struck by a certain pleasing incongruity between its
matter and style. Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick Wedmore</span> is such an
artist in words, so punctilious in the niceties of their
employment, that to find him writing a story of modern
stage-life, and using for it&mdash;with, as it were, a certain
delicate deliberation&mdash;phrases peculiar to the jargon of
the class of which it treats, gives one a series of small
shocks. It is like hearing slang from a Dean. As a matter
of fact, though, I was wrong in calling <i>Brenda Walks On</i>
a story. It is rather a disquisition about stage people,
stage art and life, and anything else whatever upon which
Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> wishes to talk at the moment, from the
beauties of the North-Eastern coast (the Scarborough part
of the book carried me back to the far-off days of <i>Renunciations</i>)
to the treasures of Hertford House. Even <i>Brenda's</i>
chief suitor is capable of breaking off the avowal of his
love to deliver a few well-chosen remarks about theatrical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
rents and the hazards of management. This suitor, <i>Penfold</i>,
is perhaps the nearest approach to an actual character
that the book contains. He was a writer of papers upon
the drama of whom the author observes, "With a ready
pen, indeed, Heaven forbid that he should have been cursed!
It was better to have a careful one, faithfully ordered,
allowing him to make sensible utterance of some part of
the knowledge and thought that were in him." Which,
by a happy coincidence, is exactly my verdict
author's method in this graceful causerie.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Christina's Son</i> (<span class="smcap">Wells Gardner</span>) is a disarming book.
It overcomes criticism by the direct simplicity of its attack,
in which only later do you begin to suspect a concealed art.
Miss <span class="smcap">W. M. Letts</span> tells a tale that (you might say) has
nothing in it; nothing certainly at all sensational or
strikingly original. But this story of a middle-class North-country
woman grips the attention, and holds it, by some
quality hard to define. <i>Christina</i>, as wife of a man
she can never greatly love,
and, later, as mother of
a son whom she adores
but only half understands,
becomes, for all her commonplace
environment, a
figure that dwells in the
memory because of what
you feel to be its absolute
truth. The atmosphere of
the story is so crystal clear
that every detail of its
chief characters stands
out with the distinctness
of a landscape after rain.
And because, by all the
rules, these characters
should be so little interesting,
and the very provincial
society in which
the thirty or so years of
the book pass is so entirely
undistinguished, you
are faintly astonished all
the way through (at least
I was) at not being bored.
I see that one critic has
praised a previous story by Miss <span class="smcap">Letts</span> for its humour,
should not have picked this out as a characteristic
of <i>Christina's Son</i>. Rather has it a certain gravity and sobriety
of aim, which in part explains its appeal; if there is humour
it is generally below the surface and never insisted upon.
There is a moment when its rather restrained style rises
suddenly to rare beauty, where the theme is old age; and
throughout there is a maturity of judgment in the writing
that will make it perhaps less attractive to the young
than to those whose outlook has reached the same stage.</p>

<p>If I were to give away the plot of Miss <span class="smcap">Mary L.
Pendered's</span> <i>The Secret Sympathy</i> (<span class="smcap">Chapman and Hall</span>) I
think that you would sniff. It is not likely to cause animated
discussion in intellectual circles. We are introduced
to a girl who, finding herself reduced from affluence to
poverty, takes a garage and runs it with success, and we
become acquainted with a chauffeur and a peer, and the
former turns out to be&mdash;but that is just what I am not
going to tell you. If you want a book in which the hero is
a very perfect gentleman indeed and the villain really is a
villain, then here you are. Miss <span class="smcap">Pendered's</span> scheme is not
too subtle, but what she has set out to do she has done, and
done well. Although her characters play their part in the
War, she resists the temptation to smother them with
V.C.'s and other decorations, and for this abstinence and
for <i>Miss Chetwynd</i>, a middle-aged spinster of shrewd sense
and humour, I warmly commend her. I confess myself in
love with <i>Miss Chetwynd</i> and should dearly like to hear
her candid opinion of <i>The Secret Sympathy</i>. But I feel
sure that, if she smiled a little at the wonderfulness of it
all, her final verdict would be as benevolent as mine.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Maher's</span> <i>The Shepherd of the North</i>
(<span class="smcap">Macmillan</span>) looks a little like one of those rather elaborate
Catholic tracts in form of a novel of which we have so
many classic examples. <i>Mgr. Winthrop</i>, the Bishop of
Alden, way up in the Adirondacks, was indeed a noble old
fellow, somewhat given to long speeches, but with a great
heart in the right place, and wise and tolerant withal.
He was known and loved by the small farmers and
lumber-men as <i>The White Horse Chaplain</i> for a deed of
valour done in his youth
in the Civil War. And he
carried that high quality
of courage into his work
of defending his people
against the machinations
of the U. &amp; M. Railroad,
which swept down upon
them and stuck at nothing,
not arson on a Teuton
scale or judicial murder,
to get the prize it was
after&mdash;valuable iron ore
in the hills through which
its track ran. However,
it was the Bishop's oar,
dexterously thrust in,
which finally won the
victory. There is a point
which puzzles me considerably.
The crisis of the
story turns on the secret
of the Confessional. A
young man is accused of
murder, and the Bishop,
his friend, has heard the
confession of the real murderer,
so that his lips are sealed. But his fiancée also unwittingly
overheard the essential of the confession screamed
by the dying man. Mr. <span class="smcap">Maher</span> seems to think her bound by
the same sacred ties as the Bishop, even to the point of allowing
her lover to go to the chair because of her silence. But
is that sound moral theology? I should doubt it. I ought
to add that there's nothing to shock the most sensitive
evangelical conscience, and quite a good deal to edify,
instruct and entertain.</p>
